# Guidelines for writing an API Endpoint Documentation
### Draft

Before writing any code there must be a specification regarding the format/content negociation

First write a summary. After the summary, write the actions that can be performed on the endpoint.
> The notes in this summary were added for guiding purposes and are not required in your summary

### Summary Example

#### Format
> Specifications about format
#### Getting the values
> Request Type, Parameters, Body(if needed), Expected Error responses, Expected succes Response
#### Getting a single value
> Request Type, Parameters, Body(if needed), Expected Error responses, Expected succes Response
#### Creating a new value
> Request Type, Parameters, Body(if needed), Expected Error responses, Expected succes Response
#### Changing the value
> Request Type, Parameters, Body(if needed), Expected Error responses, Expected succes Response
#### Deleting the value
> Request Type, Parameters, Body(if needed), Expected Error responses, Expected succes Response

#### Format
##### MyEntity
Entity specifications can be represented in any form, but it is recommended that you represent it in the way your API represents it. (`JSON` in this example)

```json
{
    "id": 2,
    "name": "an entity",
    "value": 23
}
```
> A brief description of the fields. It can contain explanations, if necessary.
 * `id` - integer unsigned value,  used for indexing and is a `PRIMARY KEY` in the `MySQL` database
 * `name` - string value, max `200` characters, used for naming `MyEntity` names
 * `value` - integer value, used to represent `MyEntity` values


### When performing actions on MyEntity

#### Request
Request representation structure is the following
- `RequestType` (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- url `endpoint`
- Parameters for GET requests are represented within the url

which will form a string like: `POST my.api.com/myentity?greaterThan=15&lowerThan=40`

##### Example Request types
Get `MyEntity` list
```http
GET my.api.com/myentity
```
Get `MyEntity` list with get parameters
```http
GET my.api.com/myentity/?greaterThan=15
```

Get `MyEntity` list
```http
GET my.api.com/myentity/2
```
Create new `MyEntity`
```http
POST my.api.com/myentity
```
Partially (or fully) update `MyEntity`
```http
PATCH my.api.com/myentity/2
```

Fully update `MyEntity`
```http
PUT my.api.com/myentity/2
```

Delete `MyEntity`
```http
DELETE my.api.com/myentity/2
```

#### Headers
If headers are needed they will be added after the request type.
##### Example headers
Using `json` for negotiating content and Bearer Token Authorization
```http
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer a62399bacd009193d5503014d35caceb
```
The `Content-Type` header is used when working with parameters transmitted in the request `body`

#### Request Body (Parameters)
`POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT` and `DELETE` HTTP requests require `Content-Type` to be defined.
The `Content-Type` header tells the API how the data will be represented.
The request `body` is the actual parameters representation. (`json` in this case)

```json
{
    "name": "another entity",
    "value": 4129
}
```

### Expected responses
#### Error Responses
> The error responses don't always have a body
 The error can be explained briefly with the code

- `401 Unauthorized` - User is not logged or token has expired
- `403 Forbidden` - Trying to `update` or `delete` a `MyEntity` which user doesn't have access to
- `404 Not found` - Entity was not found
- `400 Bad Request` - Malformed `json`/`request body` reveiced
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` - Data sent to the server was not valid

#### Succes responses
`200 OK` - Operation succesfully done
`201 Created` - Entity created

> Optional body response example
